## Rendering optimisation
### Modifications not recommended
The component itself handles rendering of widgets when required props are given properly. When it doesn't work as expected on your site, please do not try modifying the code of component itself, but contact your Sales Engineer or Partner manager with sample pages.

### The component must not be hidden or cached.
If the page history is cached in the DOM tree, please remove the component itself from the cache. Only the component placed in the visible contents should be rendered.
Toggle example:
```jsx
render() {
  return (
      {showOutbrainWidget ? <OutbrainWidget dataSrc="mySite.com" dataWidgetId="AR_1" /> : null}
  );
}
```

### Server Side Rendering
The component should work with SSR.
If it's used in the combination of SSR and CSR, it should either reuse the components (rehydration) or clear them (clear the Placement prop) and make sure to remove the component on hidden contents as mentioned in the previous section.
